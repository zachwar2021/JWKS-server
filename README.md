# JWKS-server
This server serves JWT and JWKSs to the client. They both include a key ID identifier. The JWT is served with a private key, and the JWKS is served with a public key. This is in the standard format for cryptographic keys in JSON format. All of this allows for a compact and URL-safe way to represent claims between the server and the client.
